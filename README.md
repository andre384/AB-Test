# AB-Test
AB Testing is a well known method for measuring the impact of changing one variable. Typically this can be useful for ecommerce and marketing.
If a website looks different, are customers more likely to make a purchase or take an action that experiment designers consider a success. 
This conversion rate is the number of successes divided by the total number of customers in the sample and is an important metric to determine 
if the treatment improves results. The sample of customers is divided into a control group and treatment group that visits the new website. 
If the conversion rate is significantly higher in the treatment group then the company may consider using the new website.
