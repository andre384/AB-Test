# AB-Test
AB Testing is a well known method for measuring the impact of discrete variable on results. Typically this can be useful for ecommerce and marketing.
If a website looks different, are customers more likely to make a purchase or take an action that experiment designers consider a success. 
This conversion rate is the number of successes divided by the total number of customers in the sample and is an important metric to determine 
if the treatment improves results. For a example, there is a sample of customers divided into a control group and treatment group. We want to measure 
how many of these customers make a purchase after visiting the current website or the new website. If the conversion rate is significantly higher in the 
treatment group then the company may consider using the new website.
